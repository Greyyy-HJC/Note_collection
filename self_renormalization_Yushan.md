# Background

## TMD lecture

There are two ways to represent momentum distribution: 

1. out-state with infinity momentum
2. out-state with zero momentum but add infinity Lorentz Boost in the operator

## RI/MOM factor and hadron matrix element

Two ways to calculate Quasi-Light-Front correlator on lattice:

1. RI/MOM factor: out-state is quark
2. hadron matrix element: out-state is hadron

## linear divergence of a specific diagram

We get to know there is a linear divergence through the diagram, the aim is eliminating it.

$$ \ln( M(z,a) ) = \frac{e(z)}{a \ln(a \Lambda_{QCD})} + g(z) $$

$z$ is the gap, $a$ is the lattice parameter.

1. Test the linear divergence by doing fits
2. Determine the values of $e(z)$, $\Lambda_{QCD}$ and $g(z)$ by doing fits of the dependence on $a$.
3. Matching the finite term (after delete the divergence) $g(z)$ with pertubative results at small $z$.

$$ g(z) = \ln(Z_{\bar{ms}}) + m_0 z $$

# Results

## 1. This is a successful way to do renormalization: 

Find the divergence form (linear) and dependence($a$ and $z$);

Fit to determine the values of all params

Called self because other normal method is dividing hadron matrix element by RI/MOM factor, but this method does not need to divide

## 2. RI/MOM and hadron matrix have different divergence, so dividing cannot eliminate the divergence.

LPC used wrong method and got different results from experiments.

## 3. Large non-perturbative effect at large distance in RI/MOM and Ratio scheme.
